# Basic authentication

Authentication is a means of validating that users are who they claim they are when sending a request to a server.

It is also a way of protecting users and their database as well as restricting access to a server resource to unauthorized users.

There are several ways of authentication methods done via http and they are:
1. Basic authentication
2. session authentication
3. Javascript WebToken auth
4. OAuth and OAuth2

With any framework and even with python-flask basic authentication can be achieved easily.
It is advised not to build your own web authentication but use libraries and modules which handles all possibe cases and authorization methods.
